# Molecular_Markers_for_Metabolic_Disease

 Western diet (WD) intake, Aging, and inactivation of bile acid (BA) receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), are risk factors for metabolic and chronic inflammation-related diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and dementia. The progression of NAFLD can be escalated when those risks are combined. Inactivation of FXR is cancer prone in both humans and mice. The current study used multi-omics including hepatic transcripts, liver, serum, and urine metabolites, hepatic BAs, as well as gut microbiota from mouse models to classify those risks by machine learning approach. A linear support vector machine with K-fold cross-validation was used for classification and feature selection. We have identified that increased urine sucrose alone achieved 91% accuracy in pre-dicting WD intake. Hepatic lithocholic acid and serum pyruvate had 100% and 95% accuracy, respectively to classify age. Urine metabolites (decreased creatinine and taurine as well as increased succinate) or increased gut Dorea, Dehalobacterium, and Oscillospira could predict FXR deactivation with greater than 90% accuracy. In the translational relevance, we found that WD-affected hepatic Cyp39a1 and Gramd1b expression were associated with human HCC and NAFLD, respectively. The risk prediction contributes to the identification of noninvasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of metabolic disease development.
